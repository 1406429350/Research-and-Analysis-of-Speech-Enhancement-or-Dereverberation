# Research-and-Analysis-of-Speech-Enhancement-or-Dereverberation (RA-SED)
This repository contains some material of speech enhancement and dereverberation.  
On the one hand, I summarize this work for my further understanding.  
On the other hand, I hope that all beginners or masters interested in speech enhancement can ask me questions and make progress together.  
A lot of my summary is not very good, I hope you put forward corrections!  

<b>Advertisementï¼š</b>  
I would like to open source a speech enhancement toolkit in the near future, but there is currently no good way to do frame-level feature extraction.  
I would like to put the features in one file, but currently running on a small memory machine while reading and writing may run out of memory.  
If you have a better way, please contact me!  
Thank you!
